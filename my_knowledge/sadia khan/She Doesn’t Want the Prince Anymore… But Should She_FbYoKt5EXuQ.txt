==================================================

 She's not going to be saved by the prince.  She's not going to be dreaming about true love.  She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be.  The prince in the original movie stalked her.  Why would you sign up to a film if that's what you believe was the message behind it?  I'm guessing because here's what they're taking is,  I'm not saying Disney movies were great for our perception of love either,  but the idea of mocking connection and mocking,  and let's say, for example, somebody does save you and you're in a bad position,  but they do save you.  Why is that so negative?  If somebody's going through something and you find a partner and they help you heal  and you both help each other heal, why is that a negative thing?  I mean, maybe I've got it wrong,  but the narrative I'm getting is it's almost seen as embarrassing to fall in love  when really it's an essential component of our life.  We all need it.
