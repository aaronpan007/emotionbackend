 And what makes a high-value woman?  Appearance is really important, but the main thing I would say to be a high-value woman is,  though you've got appearance and though you've got so many options when it comes to men,  you reject more men than you accept.  You have ability to reject attention.  High-value women can reject attention and verbal attention from men all day, every day.  Compliments mean nothing.  Attention means nothing because they look for something more valuable than that,  and they know that talk is cheap.  So high-value women, you can't get them through.  You can't buy them, and you can't get them through just words.  They have to be attracted to who you are as a human being.  So if you are a man who's such a mess and you've got no self-control,  you've got nothing going on in your life, and you've got a beautiful woman,  she's still not high-value because if she was truly high-value, she wouldn't have selected you.  High-value women would be looking at your choices in your life,  and they would be choosing a man who makes really good decisions,  has really good self-control, treats her really well.  So they have really...  High selection process.  So they take care of themselves.  They have a really high selection process,  and you can't buy them through attention and money.
