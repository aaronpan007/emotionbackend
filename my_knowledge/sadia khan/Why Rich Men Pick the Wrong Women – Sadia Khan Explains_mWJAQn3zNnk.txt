 But the main thing I realized is as men have more money, their selection of women gets  worse.  They don't have the time to vet her correctly.  They don't have the ability and also they don't require much from her because they are  so successful.  Firstly, they don't have the time to spend all day every day with her, getting to know  her and getting to know her past.  Usually men would meet girls that they went to school with or their friends knew or something.  They don't really have that spare time.  So they really just pick a woman and they don't get that chance to vet her correctly.  They also pick women in environments that are more suited to their needs.  So maybe they're in expensive restaurants or expensive holidays.  So they're with women in those environments a lot.  Those women are totally different to women who are just in Starbucks or just in a regular  cheetah place or something like that.  So they don't have the time to vet her.  The other thing that they have is they don't require much from her because usually they've  got a chef or maybe they've got somebody to clean the house.  They've got everything that a woman would normally do for them.  They've got all of that.  So they only really require a few days.  They don't really require someone that sleeps with them.  That's all they really end up requiring.  They don't really have time for that emotional or social battery for all that emotional connection.  So they end up selecting women who are only capable and good for one thing really.  And so when you see all these kind of like strippers and when you see all these escorts  and they're marrying like Jeff Bezos and they're marrying all these really successful men,  it's because the only compartment left that they can't do for themselves is sexual.  So that's usually the only skill she needs.  So they end up going for the most promiscuous women.
