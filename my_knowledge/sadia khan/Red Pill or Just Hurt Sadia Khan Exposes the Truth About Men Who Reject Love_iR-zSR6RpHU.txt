==================================================

 when you feel like you're not worthy of love and which I really think is a manifestation of low  self-esteem when you feel like you're not worthy of love the quickest and easiest way to feel worthy  is to pretend love is terrible pretend love is toxic and I see this a lot in red pill men  and really high like a proud feminist both cohorts tend to be people who personally probably believe  that they're not desirable to the opposite gender so the only way to get rid of that feeling of  like being undesired is to pretend you don't desire the opposite gender so I see it both and  they're almost a perfect match for each other that blue haired you know a feminist and that  red pill guy they're almost a perfect match because they both almost have the same pathologies  when it comes to their understanding of love so they're all they should get together
