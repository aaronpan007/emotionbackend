==================================================

 If you feel like love is suffering for you,  have a look at your decision making.  If you're becoming weak, but if you choose wisely,  you won't see it as being weak,  you'll see it as being compatible  and you'll see it as being compromising.  And if you're becoming subservient,  if you choose the right person,  you won't see it as a form of abuse.  But if you're making poor decisions,  of course love is going to be a form of suffering.  But suffering is a reminder that you made wrong choices.
