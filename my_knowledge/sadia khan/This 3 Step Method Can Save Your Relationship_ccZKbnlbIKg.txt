 the best way to communicate a criticism because behind every criticism is a need  your partner has a need and what's happened when they criticize you is that  they don't feel safe to express that need but they do feel comfortable saying  a criticism but how you change that and make it more productive is just three  steps you start with I you feel I am I feel you start with a feeling you stay  exactly what you're upset about the actual event and then you say what you  need so I event and the need what I mean by this is I feel upset when you  come home late yeah I need you to let me know when you're going to be late or  what people who break up they'll say things like you're so selfish you don't  care about me this is what you always do I don't even want to talk to you they do  the opposite whereas if I say I and you state your feeling you stay on the  specific event that upset you and then you explain to them what you need from  them that leads to constructive communication for couples
