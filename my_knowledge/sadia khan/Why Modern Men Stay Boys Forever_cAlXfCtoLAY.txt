==================================================

 Men, in order to become a man, what separates them from being a boy to a man is responsibility.  And because we're prolonging the age of when they become fathers,  or prolonging the age they become providers, or prolonging the age they become husbands,  they've become old teenagers for a really long time, and they're avoiding responsibility.  It's a strange generation where men really avoid responsibility  and are terrified of commitment.  And you're just thinking, before men would be terrified of going to war, which is a real thing.  Now they're terrified of labeling their relationships, and we've weakened them.  They're terrified of responsibility.  I'm not saying that there's plenty of great women, but I'm just saying  avoidance of responsibility will stop you from entering your manhood.
