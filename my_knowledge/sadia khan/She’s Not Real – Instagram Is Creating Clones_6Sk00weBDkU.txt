 What happened with Instagram is men started seeing very perfect pictures of women in a particular way.  And then what happens is women see what men like.  This is what men don't realize.  Their simple double tap directs women.  So what happened is every girl that was getting more and more popular on Instagram  became the framework for the young girls that was watching her boy like pictures.  Body's morphing continuously.  Body's morphing.  We all look the same now.  I'm saying even myself.  I get all my makeup tips and stuff.  I go to the gym like everyone else does.  Yeah, like everybody else does and stuff.  And so we morphed into the same kind of person.  And what's happening is we're so, so distracted by that  that what happens is when we see normal, we see it as unattractive.
