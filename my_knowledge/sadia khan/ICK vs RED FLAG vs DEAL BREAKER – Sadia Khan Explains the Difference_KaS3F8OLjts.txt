 What's the difference between deal breakers, red flags, and ick?  Ick is, from a female perspective,  it's something that a man does quite early on in your relationship  that makes you question his masculinity.  And it just gives you the ick.  And you don't realize that that's what it is.  So it might be something really early on that I know girls will say something like,  oh, he wore something that was just way too tight.  And it just signaled not masculine or something like that.  When you've had enough love for a person, you've developed enough connection,  ick goes away.  He becomes ick-proof.  Then it just becomes a bit annoying and a bit more red flags.  Then you become, so ick is more attraction-based and it's more that.  As it gets to red flags is when you're actually considering being with them.  You're actually in a relationship.  You're in the dating stage and so on and so forth.  You're actually considering this can go serious.  Red flags are things that everybody's are different.  But ones are things that would potentially cause you to end the relationship at some stage  or can potentially lead to a behavior that you would find unacceptable in the future.  So it might be a red flag if I have a partner  who's always cheated on every woman he's been with.  There's a bit of a red flag because that could potentially lead to a problem.  Or it might be a red flag that this person is really close to their ex.  A bit of a red flag.  Deal breakers when they actually act on those behaviors.  And then it's the final straw.
