==================================================

 So a woman's got a high body count.  Do you think that's an issue?  I think it's no more of an issue than when a man has a body count that's very high.  Okay, so that's quite debatable.  Yeah.  I would say if a man's got a high body count,  obviously the woman's probably not going to be too happy with that.  But from that, the man's going to gain a lot of experience.  He may even potentially get quite a lot of whatever it is out of his system.  Because if a man, let's say, for example, if he gets married very early,  he's only been with one or two women.  When he gets to 30s, mid-30s, maybe he's going to start thinking,  oh, you know, I didn't really have that period of time  where I could just go on a bit of a mad one.  I feel like everyone has a ho phase, both males and females.  Yeah.  A lot of them.
