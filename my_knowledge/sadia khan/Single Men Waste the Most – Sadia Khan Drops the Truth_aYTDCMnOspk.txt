 What happens is men seem to think, especially in this day and age, because of the toxic  culture of relationships, they're like, we've got all the time in the world.  We don't have a biological clock, but you have a financial clock.  And when you're single, you waste so much of your time, money, and energy.  I promise you.  Table hose, yeah, I can say that, right?  Dating randomly, this, that, and the other.  Women draining your energy and resources.  It is such a waste of your precious, precious energy.  Now, when you have a wife, what it does, of course, she's annoying.  And I'm not saying that she's going to be perfect.  And of course, she stresses you out, whatever it is.  But that box is ticked.  You're not on the streets.  You're not worrying about who's texting you back, where you're going.  When you've got business meetings, you're not thinking, oh, God, we're going to get  a table.  I need to get girls on this table.  You know, you don't have to have those worries and stresses.  So what having one woman does is, firstly, it gives you that sense of stability.  And it helps you financially because you've got one person rather than spreading it out  thinly.  And spreading it in clubs and stuff like that, which a lot of single people do.  The other thing it does is she maintains your, if you pick wisely, this is the key.  If you pick wisely, she encourages you to focus on your mental and spiritual and physical  health at the same time.
