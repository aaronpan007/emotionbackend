 So when we use the word you're slut shaming, what we're really saying is stop pointing out the flaws in my flawed behavior.  Essentially, we need a society filled with guilt, shame and regret.  We need to be aware of these emotions.  If we remove shame from our society, we call it fat shaming, slut shaming.  Essentially, we find a way of normalizing what is abnormal behavior.  And when we do that, we then become reckless.  We need guilt, shame and regret to help direct us into making proper decision making, responsible decision making, healthy decision making.  So whenever you hear the word that's fat shaming and that's slut shaming, if the word before it is negative, then the actual the concept is broken.
