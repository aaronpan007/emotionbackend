==================================================

 this is something that women get really offended when I tell them this, but the reality is men are  babies, yeah, they really are babies. Now, when the wife, and this is not her fault,  but when you have kids with women, when they naturally have kids and all of these things,  they are designed to just focus on the children. It's how we're designed biologically. We have the  hormones, we have the obsession, we get so much oxytocin from just kissing that child. What happens  then is she doesn't even see her husband anymore. So he comes into his home and almost feels like a  stranger in his own home because it's like mom and baby, they're so connected. Baby's always a  bit like connected to mom. She can't switch off. He'll go for dinner with his wife and she's  thinking about the baby, baby, baby. Slowly that husband feels more and more neglected.  And what happens then is because it's so weird to say to your wife, why are you always with the  baby? Can you give me a kiss instead? It's such a weird conversation to have. So what they end up  doing is they're like, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. And they're like, I don't know,  I don't know. And they're like, I don't know. And they're like, I don't know. And they're like,  seeking that attention elsewhere. Now it's not all men. Some men dive into the parenthood with  their wife. They hold their hand, wife's hand and go straight into the children. But other men,  especially if they didn't receive a lot of love growing up, they need that personalized attention.  So when they're not getting it from their partner, instead of communicating it,  they go source it somewhere else.
