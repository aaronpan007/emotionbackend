==================================================

 Human beings are designed with the potential to love and nurture one another.  And whenever we cap our potential, whether that's through like we cap our potential physically,  emotionally, psychologically, anything that involves capping our potential will lead to  a slow and steady depression that will signal to yourself that you're not fulfilling your  potential and it will come out and manifest as a form of depression.  So when you kind of ward off love, you're warding off your own full potential and therefore  you will see an increase in your depression and anxiety.  They even find studies where women, when they hold their partner's hand during labor, they  experience less pain.  That's how much we're designed to be in love.  It's actually a pain relief.  It's an anti-anxiety.  They found loads of studies where they see people that, you know, sleep with lots of  people in a communion, they sleep better.  They don't have any like micro awakenings in the night.  So our body craves it.  Whether you psychologically convince yourself you don't want it, your body will still speak  to you.  And tell you that you need it.  So unfortunately it doesn't work.
