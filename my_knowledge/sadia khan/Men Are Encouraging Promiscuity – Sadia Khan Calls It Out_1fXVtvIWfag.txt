 The reality is there's no negative consequences to posting badly.  Before, if I was a woman posting provocative pictures,  I would know that there's going to be men who would judge me  and never want to be with me.  Now there's men queuing up to be with that girl.  And they see it as a prize.  Like, oh my God, your girl is so hot.  She's got her body done and she's on Instagram.  They see it as a prize.  They don't see it as a bad thing.  So there's no negative consequences from being promiscuous as a woman anymore.  Because the men don't mind.  They actually encourage it.  So who's to, I don't know, maybe it's a chicken and egg.  Maybe it's a both thing, but we can't blame one or the other.
