 Okay, I love the insight.  I think this is a place where we would disagree.  I do think it's possible for guys and girls to be friends,  but I'm saying this is a generalization,  so light me up in the comments if you want to.  I would say of guys and girls' friendships,  maybe less than 6%, 7%.  You know what I mean?  Like the guy would say no.  And even if he does find things very unattractive in the girl,  the guy still is, like they're still friends.  And guys get attracted to the fact that,  oh, I've got to know this girl really well.  I feel like I understand her personality,  and she knows me really well.  Therefore, it's like Mr. Right instead of like, you know, Mr. Mysterio.  But then I think it's really important to have human qualities as a criteria for sex.  And what I mean by that is, yes, she might be a really great friend,  but you should have some kind of deal breakers with even the people you sleep with.  Now, if I know my friend inside out, and I know what he's like,  and I know that he sleeps with lots of girls on the night out,  and I know that my friends, like, might be cheaters,  or I know that my friends have, I'm not their usual type,  or I know that, if I know that they've got these traits in them,  I have certain human qualities as part of my criteria to be with somebody.  So if a man doesn't have human qualities,  just the fact that she's saying yes is enough for him to jump on that.  But when he knows that, oh, God, she gets so drunk,  and she does this with every guy,  or I know so many guys I've slept with her,  and it's just a bit off-putting,  or I don't really need to deal with her in the morning,  I know she's going to be really emotional.  When he adds human qualities to the women that,  even he sleeps with, it's possible.
