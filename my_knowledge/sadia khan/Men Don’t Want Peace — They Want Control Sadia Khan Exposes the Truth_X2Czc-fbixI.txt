 I think peace is definitely created.  I know a lot of men say they want peace,  but usually the men that are like,  ah, dying for peace and can't find it,  it's either they've chosen super chaotic,  but they might be engaging behaviors  that are also not conducive to peace.  They don't have self-control.  They don't have self-control.  They're coming home late,  they're drinking too much,  they're watching pornography,  and then they scream at their wife,  like, why can't you give me peace?  But honestly, when you meet a man  who selects wisely and has self-control,  peace is an inevitable outcome.  Yes.  He doesn't have to ask for it.
