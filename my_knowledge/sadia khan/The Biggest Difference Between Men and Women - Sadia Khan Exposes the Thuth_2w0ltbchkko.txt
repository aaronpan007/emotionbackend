 Look, we actually enjoy hearing each other's problems.  It's a form of bonding for us as girls.  For men, they assume if you can't fix the problem, what's the point of me telling you it?  So they just think, okay, my mom passed away, God forbid, if that ever happens to someone.  They think, me telling you about it, you can't bring her back, so what's the point of me telling you?  So they don't speak to people, whereas for women, we still know that the support is helping us fix it.  And just some listening is helping.  So they're too problem-solving and not enough emotional dependency when it comes to men.
