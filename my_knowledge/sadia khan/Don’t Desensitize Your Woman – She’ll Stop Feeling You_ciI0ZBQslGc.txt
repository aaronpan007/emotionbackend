==================================================

 So when you have to be honest with your partner, just remember, I'm being honest with you because  I see a future with you. I know I don't want this to reoccur in the future. When you're trying to  please your partner in the moment, firstly, women can see through it that you're just being a  people pleaser and therefore she values your opinion less. And the reason why that's important  is if I know my partner is going to compliment me regardless, his compliments mean less to me.  And then if I'm in a vulnerable state, another man's compliment might mean more to me because  I've kind of got desensitized to my partner's just people pleasing. Whereas if he's honest with me,  his compliments still hold weight and his opinion still holds weight.  So honesty has to be the backbone behind all good feedback.
