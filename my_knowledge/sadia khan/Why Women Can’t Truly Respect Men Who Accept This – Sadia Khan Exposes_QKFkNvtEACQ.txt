 The reality is women respect men with masculinity, alpha, protectiveness, providing, etc.  Now, when you go into sex work, you are left with, firstly, your customers are incredibly low self-esteem,  incredibly naive to even believe that you're going to be loyal to them.  And even if he's not your customer and he's your boyfriend, but he accepts your sex work,  a part of you doesn't see him as powerful and a provider and doesn't see him as protective.  Because if he was truly protective, he wouldn't be with you.  If he was a man that genuinely was an alpha man and wanted a good woman, he wouldn't be with you.  So the type of men they truly respect wouldn't be with them.  So the only men, they definitely can't fall in love with the guy that is giving them money.  The closest thing they get to that is the pimp that's taking money from them.  Because at least then they kind of respect the fact that he's using her in a way.  But to be manipulated by her, she feels more powerful than him and therefore can't respect him.
