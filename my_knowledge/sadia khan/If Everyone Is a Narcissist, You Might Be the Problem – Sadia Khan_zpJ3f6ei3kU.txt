 know if you're the problem here's how you know that you're the problem every time you come out  of a relationship you can list exactly what the other person did wrong and not pay attention to  what you did wrong you're the problem if you come out of every relationship and he's a narcissist  she's a narcissist this person's a problematic and you can't list even one thing you've done  wrong in the relationship you are the problem and usually when i know i get a lot of stick for this  but when somebody comes to me and they say so and so is a narcissist i know automatically you're the  problem because that label even if somebody isn't us so many people experience that that label  automatically rids you of accountability he did this he did that he did that she did this she did  so when you come with that mindset you haven't reflected on the dynamic that created one person  to take advantage of your kindness so it's the ability to come out of a relationship by saying  i did this wrong i messed up i know i shouldn't have done this i know i shouldn't have ignored  that i i i those people are definitely more green flags but somebody who can just tell you  everything they're  not did wrong should finish that sentence with but i should have also realized this earlier  i shouldn't have paid more attention and that person is far more reflective
