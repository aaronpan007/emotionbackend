 when you speak to men and ask them which women had them the most on a chokehold, which woman  had them the most, they'll always focus on the woman that they found the most attractive  or the one that gave them the best sexual experience.  Very rarely will they focus on the woman that treated them the best.  And if they do focus on that girl, they'll say, she was a lovely girl.  I can't say a word about her.  That was bad.  But it just didn't work out.  But the girl that treated them badly, but as long as she gave them the best sex, she'll  be the one that they think about for years on end.  So it happens to men in reverse.  And that's why corruption is being rewarded because women are learning very quickly that  the quickest route to reward from men is by selling yourself.  And that's the unfortunate lesson that we're teaching young girls.
