 I think the biggest red flag is their lack of accountability.  Their inability to be transparent, they're not telling you what they did wrong, and they're not accountable.  Transparency is a really important trait.  And what I mean by that is you could be filled with red flags.  I can say to you, look, I've got a terrible temper.  I can swear during an argument.  I can be really rude, blah, blah.  But my transparency at least shows you that I'm allowing you to make an informed decision.  People who are not transparent are the real issue.  So I would use transparency as a detector of good or bad behavior.  You could be a serial killer, but if you tell people what you are, at least you're not manipulating them.  It's the inability to be transparent that I think is really difficult.
