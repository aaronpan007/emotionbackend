 but really people don't respect the person who accepts their unacceptable behavior.  So if I'm unacceptable, if I'm disloyal to you and I'm swearing at you and I'm rude to you and  you still want to be with me, I automatically don't love you anymore. And the reason for that  is because you've shown me I can be my worst and you'll accept it. And I don't want to be my worst.  We all want to be our best. I don't want to be hitting my husband and swearing at him. When he  accepts that, there's a part of us that says, why are you taking this? As much as we might cry  and beg you to take us back, we don't like it. Whereas when a man sets boundaries for us, as  much as it's difficult, we know it's going to bring out the best in us. So when we accept the  unacceptable, we remove the connection rather than create it.
