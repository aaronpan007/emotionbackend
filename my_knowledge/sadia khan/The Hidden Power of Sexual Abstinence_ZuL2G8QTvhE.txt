 Do you think that abstinence is a good thing for people?  Sexual abstinence?  Only if you define it including pornography.  Some men will abstain from women, but they use pornography on a regular basis,  and that would actually be worse.  I think abstinence to pornography is more important than abstinence to actual women.  And the reason being is actual women still give you a realistic perception  of what connection looks like, what connection is required,  and the activity that's required in order to get outcome.  Pornography allows you to get all of the outcome without any of the work.  So that is a dangerous abstinence if you're just using pornography.  The most important abstinence is pornography.  And if you can abstain from physical relationships, I think it's not  that I'm saying you can never touch a woman, but touch women  that you would be relatively happy.  If worst case scenario they got pregnant, you'd be relatively okay.  Like you wouldn't be ideal, but she's not the worst woman on the planet.  When you drop your standards too low and you start sleeping with women on such a low level,  what will happen is just because you want sex,  what will happen is when you meet a woman just slightly above the low level you're used to,  you fall madly in love.  Your standard starts to drop.  You start to get used to a lower standard of woman.  When you keep your standards high, the woman that it takes to marry you  will still have to be high caliber.  But if you're a man that's sleeping around all day every day,  all it has to be is she has to be slightly above the low level you're used to,  and you glorify her.  So it's really important to keep your standards high  because she's going to be the mother of your children.
