 The men that can get women, even if they weren't a millionaire, they just have the looks or they have the appeal.  And they got lots of girls in school or in their 20s before they had the money.  They can spot the difference between a woman that's worth this and a woman that's not.  The man that's never had appeal and made a lot of money, he's the one that is most likely to go down this route.  I just watch it and I see how this woman is literally just draining all of his money, burning all of his money.  I mean, he's got enough to lose, but it's just like, how can you allow this to happen?  You know what? Because those men that didn't have access to women, they start to believe that no one actually wants them.  So they think this is normal to just give her a lot and then she'll want you.  Give her, keep giving her, giving her, giving her, and then she'll want to be with you forever.  But it's the opposite. We actually want the person that we invest in, men and women.  We want the person that we actually give to rather than we just take from.  But the men that have the money without the experience of women don't realize that.  So they lose all their appeal, which is where you get the Jeff Bezos's of the world.  Yeah, that's what they end up like.
