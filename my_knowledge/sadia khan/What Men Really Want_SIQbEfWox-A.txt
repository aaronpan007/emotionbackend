 And here's the thing what men need to wake up to.  Even when they're watching porn and stuff like that,  a lot of them are looking for that part where the woman looks into the camera  and gives them that eye contact.  That's what they're actually craving.  And even these men that have like sugar babies and stuff like that,  they want loyalty and commitment out of this girl.  So if it was just sexual pleasure,  then they wouldn't get so upset when she doesn't reply or she doesn't.  They're looking for connection.  That's what you're truly looking for.  Every human, man, woman, child, dogs,  we're looking for connection.  When we mask it with sexual pleasure,  it's because the system is skewed and designed to get money out of you.  We mask what our true, the true need is connection.  If they tell, if the governments or if the companies tell you  the cure to your depression is connection,  the cure to your loneliness is connection, that's free.  How do I market that?  You just go connect with your family and friends.  That's totally free.  But if they tell you, oh, actually it's sexual pleasure.  Let me show you pornography pictures.  Or if I tell you, oh, it's actually you need an SSRI.  Let me show you this.  That and the other.  You will always be a slave to consumerism.  So take yourself out of it.
