==================================================

 Here's the thing, there's so much talk about the OnlyFans girl and how emotionally broken she must be and this, that and the other.  But the reality is, at least she's getting a perk.  She can literally change her legacy.  She might have grown up in a council estate and now can pay off her parents' house and she can start that.  So, of course, emotionally there's damage, but she can be like, it was worth it, whatever.  She can have some self-esteem attached to it.  The man that's paying for it, there's nothing to gain from it.  Nothing but loss of self-respect.  Because when a man has to remember how he feels afterwards, when he's finished paying and she's not messaging and he's finished his subscription and she doesn't look at him again,  or even when he's finished physically, finished doing whatever it is he does, there's no way he's proud of himself in that moment.  Because what men are actually wanting is intimacy.  They think they want sexual kind of pleasure, but they're really craving emotional intimacy.  And because in this day and age they're not open about that and they don't have wives,  and they don't have close relationships with moms and sisters or whatever it is,  they're craving emotional intimacy, masking it as sexual preference and sexual pleasure,  and then still not understanding why they feel so low.  So their depression is through the roof.
