==================================================

 My always my advice for people that when they're going through breakups is  literally leave the relationship as if the whole relationship was your own  fault. It's entirely your fault and the reason I encourage kind of unwavering  accountability is that's the only way you make changes. One of the trends that  we've kind of seen in the last couple of years is everybody's ex-husband  or ex-wife is a narcissist. Everybody's a narcissist and the reason why I'm so  against that is it kind of devours personal responsibility. You are no longer  responsible for your poor choices. That person is simply a narcissist. That person's  a you know a psychopath. It's got nothing to do with your selection. When really  the only reason we find ourselves in bad relationships is because we select poorly.
