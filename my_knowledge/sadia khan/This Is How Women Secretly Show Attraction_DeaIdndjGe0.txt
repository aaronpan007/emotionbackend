 How do you know if she's into you or not into you?  I think that's the one thing.  Guys, I think universally are all like, I had no idea she was into me.  Or I had no idea.  Like, you just have no clue.  I would say one indicator is you have to polarize a woman.  And what I mean by that is you have to put her in a position where she's either forced to show that she's interested or not interested.  And it could be as simple as you walk quite close to her.  And if you see that she leans in, she's probably connected to you.  But if you walk closer, if you lean in and you see that immediately she goes somewhere else, the attraction isn't there.  So it's more of a case of you put her in a position to see, you polarize her.  Is she going to go towards you or she's going to lean towards you or lean against you?  And that signals attraction.  And physical affection is really important as well.  So what I mean by that is even little things like body language.  If they're sitting on a sofa, they'll lean in towards you.  They'll make that eye contact.  They allow you to put your hand on their thigh or whatever it is.  But if everything is pulling away, there's probably not that natural attraction there.
