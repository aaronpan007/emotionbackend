 People getting a divorce tends to be, first thing I would say is too many alternatives.  We live in a time where you can replace your partner while still being in the same room as them.  You jump on the phone, you download an app, they are right there in front of you and you can message someone new.  And even if it's not a person, it can be a consumerism, it can be a holiday.  I can just go, you're annoying me, I'm going, I'm going here.  Look at the ability to replace emotions are so available now.  So I think the alternatives is a really big one.  Those with less alternatives tend to last longer.
