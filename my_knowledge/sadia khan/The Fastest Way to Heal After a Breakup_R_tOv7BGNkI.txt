==================================================

 What's the fastest way that you've seen to be able to get over a breakup?  You remind yourself of the vision you have for yourself in the future.  And let's say, for example, your vision is,  I want to be a really successful man and I want to be married with kids  and I want to be able to trust my wife.  And if that person fits into that vision, fantastic, you can try and make it work.  But if that person doesn't align with where you see yourself in the future,  then instead of holding on and trying to mold over them and worry about them,  you try and just remember your vision and just be happy for the person  and be like, I hope she meets somebody who's right for her.  And it's really tough to do that.  But we can't be loaning and missing someone and be happy for them at the same time.  If you truly love someone, you'll be like, I hope she finds someone who is good for her.  But me personally, I've got this particular vision.  She doesn't fit that vision.  She's great for me now, but she's not going to be aligned with me in the future.  So I hope she meets someone who's good for her right now and I can try and let go of my ego.
