==================================================

 I would imagine is the glue is a duty to one another's well-being and the function of the  marriage. I would imagine that the glue that keeps a relationship together is even though we might  have a rough year, a rough five years, a rough 10 years even, but your well-being matters to me and  my well-being matters to you. And so therefore making sure that we engage in a lifelong purpose  of maintaining that and the duty that we created towards one another when we made our vows is more  important than how we're feeling right now. It's a bit like if you signed a 10-year contract with a  basketball team. If you're a basketball player, you might hate it some months, you might love it  some seasons, whatever it is, but you're committed to the purpose and the duty that the contract suggested.
