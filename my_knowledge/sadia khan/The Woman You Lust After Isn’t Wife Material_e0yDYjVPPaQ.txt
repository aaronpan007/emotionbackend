 Here's the problem, especially for men.  What's happening is they're so visual.  They're so visual.  So the woman that they want is always going to be the girl that has her whole body out on Instagram.  It's perfectly done.  And she's always posting because she comes into his foresight.  He sees her all the time.  So she gets the most attention.  And she's the one that he probably lusts after the most.  Now, the problem is that woman who's doing all of those things is actually probably not ready for a relationship.  And it's probably not marriage material because marriage material women tend not to want so many alternatives all the time.  They tend not to want so much male attention because they actually prefer to just invest in one.  But that woman who kind of posts all the time and all of these things, there is an element of narcissism in them.
