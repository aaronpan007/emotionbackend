 Talk to me about the problem with nice guys then, talking about simps.  Essentially what nice guys do is what they suffer with is not that they're too nice or anything,  it's just that they have incredibly weak boundaries when it comes to women. They simply,  and not actually not just women, it could be anybody, what they do is they lack a lot of  masculinity and what they do is they blame the fact that they're so nice as to why they can't  get women. But it's not about being nice, it's about a lack of masculinity. And one of the best  ways to establish masculinity is placing boundaries particularly with women. When you  don't like a behavior, you don't roll over and allow it to continue and then give her more in  order for you to get her. You set a boundary and you have a willingness to walk away.
