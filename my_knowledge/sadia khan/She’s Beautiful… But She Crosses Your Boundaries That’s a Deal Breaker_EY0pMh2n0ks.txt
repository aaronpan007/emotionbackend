==================================================

 the main factor in a marriage is it's not so much about your partner, it's about your boundaries.  Yeah, I would say instead of a partner, they need to be this for that and the other. It's more about  when you're selecting a partner, you need to stay loyal and on your boundaries. What I mean by this  is if you have a partner and she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's so, so great, but she  keeps breaking your boundaries, she keeps disrespecting you, she doesn't, you know,  listen to your advice or she keeps, you know, in contact with an ex or there's something going on  that's a deal breaker. Every time you forgive that deal breaker, it will come back magnified.  So when you pick a partner, when you're watching out for the deal breakers and you're using those  deal breakers as a signal that she's not good for you, you will pick correctly. But if you ignore  deal breakers and think she'll get better, I can change her. If I just throw a bit of money at her,  she'll change.  You start behaving, you're saying you're guaranteeing the divorce.
