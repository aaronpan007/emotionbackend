 Do you think dating is more difficult today for men or women?  I would say it's the hardest time for good women to find a partner.  And I would say that it's, I think good women have it the hardest.  I think corrupt women have it really great.  I think corrupt men have it really great.  Good women have it really hard and good men.  So what is it about corruption that maybe makes it a little bit smoother?  It's highly rewarded.  And what I mean by this is if a woman online decides to sell a body part,  she will get highly rewarded for it.  She'll be flown out to countries she didn't even know existed by the time she's 19, 20 years old.  She can go on a private jet by the time she's 23.  And she will have bags.  It's so hyper rewarded for being corrupt as a woman.  It's so, so rewarded by men, by men in society.  And I was scrolling once on Instagram and I saw this woman that just looked,  it looked really bizarre, like really huge, you know, like really big.  It looked like a caricature.  And I was like, this is wild.  And I clicked on it and there's 6 million followers.  And I thought, that was...  That would be about 5 million men that are following that.  Whereas if you look at a woman who's just doing recipes, who's teaching kids,  she's got nothing online.  She's not going to have that much.  Yeah, but isn't it quality versus quantity in that case?  It is, but you've got to see why men's attention is being directed  and who their resources are being directed towards.  I'm in a very unique position.  I've been saying this a lot and I know it's going to be misinterpreted.  I'm in a very unique position where I'm a woman who has a lot of access to male subscribers.  And without showing my body.  But it's nothing.  Compared to women who show their body.
