 It seems to me the advice for men suggests that falling in love makes you irrational and weak.  And for women, it makes you subservient and dependent.  And it's almost the opposite of what both sexes want to have, right?  There's a trend of wanting women to have their own independence at the moment,  like more power to them.  And there's a trend of wanting men to be able to stand up for themselves more.  And love is being positioned as the antithesis of the thing that you're trying to get.  Yeah.
