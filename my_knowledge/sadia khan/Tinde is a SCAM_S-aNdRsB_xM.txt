 Tinder was groundbreaking because what it introduced is the idea that you can have  casual relationships at the drop of a hat. Yeah, you can be as casual as you want at the drop of  a hat. And it taught people you no longer need to experience heartbreak. Just get distracted.  So what happened is when in the past, when you break up with someone, you'd be a little bit hurt  and you'd dwell on the situation, try and self-improve and then either get that person  back or just work on yourself. That has been replaced with just download Bumble,  just download Tinder. What's wrong with you? And your friends would recommend that.  Absolutely. They're like, have you been on any dates yet? So here's what's happened. Our coping  mechanisms is no longer self-improvement. Our coping mechanisms are how do I find somebody else?  And as a result, we're going from one trauma to the other trauma, carrying that baggage with us  and projecting it. So I think Tinder was the devil's like workshop for,  for marriage. Yeah, it's exactly what the devil ordered for marriages because it completely  distracts and, um, takes the, takes away the commitment element in relationships.
