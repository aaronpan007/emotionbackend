==================================================

 The soulmate should be determined by the person's level of love and respect for you.  If that is being compromised, she's not your soulmate anymore.  And where people get it wrong is they attach the word soulmate to an individual,  regardless of that individual's behavior,  and then make it work because they're loyal to the cause.  This is my soulmate.  But the soulmate should be somebody who genuinely loves and respects and is loyal to you.  If those things are being compromised,  you have to change your mindset and say,  this is no longer my soulmate.  I might continue this relationship,  but this is no longer my soulmate.  And we don't even need the word soulmate.  So I have to either I stay,  but I reevaluate this person and realize that they have the ability to hurt me in a way I didn't think they did.  Or I walk away now and remain somewhat less hurt than I might be in the future.  Because usually when we forgive unforgivable,  I'm not saying everybody's bad.  Like I require a lot of forgiveness because I will be rude and I'll be disrespectful,  particularly when I'm on my period.  And so I'm not saying you'd be perfect,  but there are some deal breakers.  And if I do the deal breakers and my husband still stays with me,  unfortunately,  he is attaching to his imagination of who I truly am,  not who I really am.  He needs to reframe who Sadhya Khan is and ask himself,  do I love this new person that she's shown me to be?  And is this new person my soulmate?  If the answer is yes,  I still am a soulmate with somebody who might have done X, Y and Z,  perfect.  But if the new soulmate is not somebody you truly,  truly can trust and be with forever,  you have to have a winning Mr.  Walkway.
