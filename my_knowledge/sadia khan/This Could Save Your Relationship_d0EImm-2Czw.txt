 What happens when two people are busy, the only reason it needs to disconnect is if there's no reliability.  What I mean by that is if me and my partner are both really busy,  that's okay if I know every Friday we have dinner together, we go out for dinner.  Because what happens is all the anxiety and everything that you might be having,  all the emotions, you know you've got an outlet for it, a particular time.  Or it might be we have dinner every day, we've got dedicated time.  What happens to couples who end up living separate lives is they don't make that dedicated time.  So every emotion that they're harboring throughout the day, like I'm stressed, I'm upset, and this, that, and the other,  they haven't had a chance to release it to their partner because there's no dedicated time.  So they end up becoming resentful.  They start resenting them.  They're like, you don't even know what my day was going on, you don't even ask me about my business,  you don't ask me this, because they didn't make that dedicated time.  So that resentment is almost like frozen anger.  They've got all this anger that they freeze in time and they hold on to.  And then when they try and come to couples counseling or when they try and, you know,  when one's straight or something like that,  it's years of emotional neglect that we can't undo in one's sessions.  What's the solution to that?  It's dedicated time.  Yeah, it's prioritizing.  What I mean by that is no matter how great your business is, no matter how important,  I'm speaking for myself as well, because sometimes I get carried away with it.  No matter how important all of these things is,  they mean nothing when you have no one to share that success with.
