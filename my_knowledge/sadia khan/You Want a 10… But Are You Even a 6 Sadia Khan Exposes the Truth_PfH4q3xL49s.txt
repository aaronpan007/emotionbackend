==================================================

 The problem lies when people want to just go be themselves, be totally like, you know,  floating along, but their expectations is they want the most beautiful woman in the world,  or their expectation is they want the most successful man. It's you can be whoever you  want to be, as long as you're realistic about yourself and your expectations and your partner.  When there's a mismatch between who you are and what you want, then you have to work on yourself,  and then you have to change. And I think the one thing I try and instill in the people that are  watching it is the importance of self-respect in dating. If you go into dating without self-esteem  and self-respect, it will turn into just one divorce after the other. So the reason I put a  lot of emphasis on improving yourself is the moment we improve ourselves and enhance our self-esteem,  we can then select better and we can maintain relationships better. But when we have low  self-esteem, unfortunately, we're just delaying the divorce.
