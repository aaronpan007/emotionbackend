==================================================

 Psychologically speaking, I think what really makes a man high value is a really high level of self-esteem.  And self-esteem simply comes from self-respect.  What self-respect looks like is doing what's best for you, even if you want to give in to your current desires.  And what I mean by that is, let's say for example, this woman is fantastic and she's great sex,  but you know she's dangerous, you know she's chaotic.  The man that can't walk away from that woman and hyper-attaches to her is automatically low value  because he has allowed one desire to dictate all his behavior.  Or let's say there's lots of alcohol in the room and he can't resist alcohol,  and he might be really successful, really great, but he's such a sucker for alcohol,  and he's addicted to it and he can't overcome that one temporary desire for his long-term goals.  High value men can suppress some of their current desires for their long-term vision of themselves.  Whether that's food, whether it's how they spend their money, it's whether the women they select,  they have the ability to practice self-control in different areas of their life.
