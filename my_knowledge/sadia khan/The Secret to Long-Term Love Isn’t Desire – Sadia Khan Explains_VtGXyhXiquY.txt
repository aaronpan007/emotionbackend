 Sometimes the key ingredient for men to get through the long stages and the decades of marriage is you almost have to accept the monotony of life.  It's going to get monotonous and women are going to get monotonous and they aren't going to be so sexually attractive.  The men that struggle are the ones that just can't come to that realization.  And we have this entitlement, men and women, that you should always be desiring your partner and be desirable.  But desirability is unsustainable.  We're a generation of spoiled brats.  Spoiled.  Unfortunately, desirability has to be replaced with duty.  Duty of care.  But because we've got this idea that we should always desire our partner and they should always desire us,  and if that's missing, the whole relationship is useless,  we forget the duty of care and then we just start again.  We're looking for the novelty of new relationships rather than the monotony of existing stable ones.
