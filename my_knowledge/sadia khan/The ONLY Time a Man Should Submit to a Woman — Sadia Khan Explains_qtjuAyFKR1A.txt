 You submit to a woman when her requests are super reasonable and they benefit the relationship.  And what I mean by this, for example, with my husband, I might say, I'm not very good at prolonged periods apart.  I'm just not good at it.  I'm not good at somebody who's like, OK, you go away for a week.  I go away for a week.  No worries.  I'll see you at the end of the week.  It's not natural for me.  I need constant connection.  He might not find that easy at first.  You might think that's a bit annoying that I have to keep checking in and calling her because she feels uncomfortable.  But if he knows that that is just going to make me calmer and it's going to help me and it's going to make me calmer and it's going to make me a more submissive wife and it's going to make me feel more loved, it's OK to submit to that demand.  That demand is not like, you can't do this and you better give me this.  It's not narcissistic demand.  It's going to smooth out the relationship because I'm more likely to trust you, more likely to trust you.  It makes us better.  But when they shouldn't submit is when the demands are only beneficial to one person.  And that's men and women.  Whereas when the demands benefit the relationship overall, you both will be happy.  The relationship will be stronger.  Even if one person is not happy now, but overall the relationship will be better.  It's totally fine to submit, man or woman.
