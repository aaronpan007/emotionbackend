 But here's what alcohol does, it's pseudo-confidence.  And again, the goal of a man should be to have a natural element in him  that enables him to be masculine.  Now, when you take alcohol, what it does is, I mean, I've never tried alcohol,  but what I have noticed about myself comparatively to my friends who drink  is that I'm not waiting for something to kick in before I start being me.  I'm not waiting for a drug to sink into my body for me to be authentic.  I'm not waiting for it to sink in for me to start dancing.  I'll walk into an environment, if there's music on, I'm like ready to roll.  Because my friends are like, let me just let this sink in.  I'm like, what's sinking?  They're like, let me just, and I'm like, it's so foreign to me.  I'm just like, what are we waiting for?  This song is good.  But it's like, what happens then when you do that is you numb your authenticity.  You numb your ability to be confident without it.  You numb your ability to say what you want to say without it.  You numb your ability to talk to women without it.  So you're numbing your authenticity.  You're suppressing.  You're suppressing who you truly are and waiting for the alcohol to unleash it.  But true confidence and true self-esteem and true needs are met  when you can be whoever you truly are in the absence of any kind of external doses.  So when they can finally be themselves,  you can only do that when you don't rely on alcohol.  And then you know what you truly feel and what you truly like as well.  Because what happens is I'll sometimes be with friends and we're in the shittest place.  But because they're drinking, they're like, it's fine.  It's fine.  It's fun.  Like, no, it's not.  This place is a dive.  Why are we here?  They're pretending it's fun because they've got the extra kind of added dose.  But when you remove that, you can actually experience life authentically.  And only when you experience life authentically is a life worth living.
