 I think for men, the ability to be completely unapologetically themselves and have their needs  predicted is something they can't do anywhere else in the world. What I mean by that is for women,  my best friend, for example, she'll know when I'm feeling low and she might get me a chocolate or  my other best friends, I know I can call her when I'm stressed, sad, whatever it is.  I can outsource this ability to have my needs met and without saying a word, because women tend to  be quite emotionally intelligent and I have the ability to be myself, vulnerable, happy, sad,  whatever it is. For men in the real world, they have to be a man. They have to wear a bit of a  mask. So they have to look like they've got it put together. They have to look like they're in  control. They have to look, they have to look, they have to look. So if they can go home where  they can take the mask off and still be loved and appreciated, that an appreciation for them  isn't just a quick thank you. It's also like, I know you're tired. I know you're hungry. I know  you need to get up early. So I'm just turning the, I'm putting the kids to bed.  I'm just turning the volume off. I know you need to get to bed. That is a form of appreciation for  them. So I think if they have a woman or an environment where they can take the mask off and  their needs can be predicted, it's something that they think they can only dream of. They don't know  that that actually exists for them.
