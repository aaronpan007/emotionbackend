 If you have been friend-zoned by somebody, how do you get out of that?  You reframe how you see her.  Instead of trying, begging her to see you differently, you now also friend-zone her.  A lot of people will say you have to walk away from a friendship,  and when a girl offers you a friendship, never be her friend again.  I think you're missing out on a really important data collection  when you walk away from women that you were once attracted to,  and you don't become their friend.  If she's friend-zoned you, no problem.  There's plenty of room for friendships in your life.  I think some of the most valuable friendships you can have is with women.  If you were once attracted to them and you became friends with them,  you get an insight into their opinion on men.  You get an insight into the women that you find attractive, how they think.
