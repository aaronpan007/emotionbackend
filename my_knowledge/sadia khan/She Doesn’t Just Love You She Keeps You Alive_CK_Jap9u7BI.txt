==================================================

 But when you pick a good woman, hopefully you set the boundaries correctly,  which a lot of successful men don't.  But if you do, what she'll do is when you're stressed, working, working, working,  she'll be like, you've got that backache.  Have you gone to the doctor yet?  She'll nag you, but she keeps you in check.  Now, when you meet those really successful men that don't have that,  what happens is they look after themselves aesthetically, but not internally.  So they'll be in the gym all the time because they're always single and stuff.  But internally, they'll have a knee problem for four years  or they'll have a broken brain cell and that they haven't checked out.  And so there is so much to gain from marriage from a man, so, so much.  And there's so much that you can lose as a man when you're just single,  especially when you're making money.  Single with money, dangerous.
