==================================================

 Every time you feel uncomfortable with a behavior, you don't wait for it to then become a deal breaker.  So, for example, I don't like what my partner's coming home late a couple of times.  I don't wait for it to be staying over, getting worse, worse, and then say something.  Because what happens is I wait for it to get too far.  The resentment's got too much and now it's hard to undo.  I voice it in that moment.  I listen to the part of my soul that's saying, I don't like this.  And I say it to them calmly.  Rather than bottling, bottling, bottling, then exploding.  Because then the partner's like, what's wrong with you?  So I say it calmly in the beginning.  Calmly, calmly, calmly.  Let them know your boundaries.  Now, if you've got a good partner, they'll be like, oh, sorry, it's just a couple of days.  I'll be home, don't worry.  But when you've got a partner that's like, I do what I want, it's a signal that they're not looking to compromise.  You don't have to break up with them and you don't have to scream and shout and fight with them.  But it is a signal that you can't ignore.
