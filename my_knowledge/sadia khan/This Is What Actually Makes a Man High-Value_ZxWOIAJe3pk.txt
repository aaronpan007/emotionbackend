 particularly the relationship with women, either the idea that to have multiple women or to have  women that are, you know, half their age and hyper attractive. It's the women part that I find really,  really like contradictory. I think truly high value is the ability to ward off alternatives,  to focus on your marriage and create a home for your children. That is high value because there's  a legacy that you're hoping to create with children. Where they get it wrong is that you  can have multiple girls on a yacht, you can sleep around and this, that and the other. And I always  say to men, if you're sleeping around, then you're potentially planting your seeds in low value  women. So imagine being a man where this random girl in this city, that girl's city, they're all  carrying your babies and they're allowing other men into their world or they're raising the child  in a way that you don't agree with. Essentially your legacy is being depleted. So I think that  the real misconception when it comes to high value men is the idea of endless women sleeping around  loads and loads, being frivolous with who you're sleeping with, enjoying every pleasure,  the life has to offer and that makes you a high value man. But I think it's actually  foregoing pleasure for your long-term goals that is actually more likely to make you a high value man.
