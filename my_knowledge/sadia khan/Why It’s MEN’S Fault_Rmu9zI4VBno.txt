 could argue that the women should stop posting that. But the reality is there's no negative  consequences to posting badly. There's no, before, like I've said before, when, if I was a woman  posting provocative pictures, I would know that there's going to be men who would judge me and  never want to be with me. Now there's men queuing up to be with that girl and they see it as a  prize. Like, oh my God, your girl's so hot, blah, blah. She's got her body done and she's on  Instagram. They see it as a prize. They don't see it as a bad thing. So there's no negative  consequences from being promiscuous as a woman anymore because the men don't mind. They actually  encourage it.
