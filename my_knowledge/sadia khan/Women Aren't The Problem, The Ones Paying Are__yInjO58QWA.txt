 Like if I learn that if I just post a picture of my cooking  and if I post a picture of like me just teaching my kids something,  no one's rewarding that.  But if I post a picture of me in my bikini and I get 10,000 followers  and I get brand deals as a result of that and I get free clothes  and I get free makeup, we're looking at the women.  But really women are the supply.  The demand is who are they going towards?  The men are investing in only – there's men out there  that will pay 10 grand for a picture of a woman's feet.  And there's another woman who's thinking, okay, I can go to university,  study and then do something.  Or another girl can post a picture of her feet  and then make that same money in a day.  What are young impressionable women who don't have father figures  or don't have people that are supporting them at home,  where are they going to go?
