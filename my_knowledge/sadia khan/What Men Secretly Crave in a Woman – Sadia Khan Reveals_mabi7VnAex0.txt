 What men find attractive in women?  I think without them realizing, I think the real thing that they find attractive in women  is a woman who is incredibly nurturing.  I think no matter how self-sufficient and how masculine a man is,  but when a woman takes care or predicts his needs before he says it, he can't help but melt.  So if she knows he might be hungry and there's something ready,  if she knows that he might be tired, there's a coffee ready.  If she knows that he's got work in the morning, he's going to be in a rush, there's a shirt ironed.  These kind of nurturing acts makes a man feel loved.  And I don't think they realize it because they're so conditioned to not expect that from women anymore  and see that as oppressive and see that as toxic.  They're just like, oh, no, I don't even expect that.  But when they receive it, they act like babies, like just received an open present.  Oh, coffee for me? Like, you know, like you did that for me?  And it's like, oh, yeah.  And I think they don't realize that that is actually their universal love language.
