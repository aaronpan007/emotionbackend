==================================================

 Like, I just can't see a reality where I'd be like, all right, you cheated.  Well, all right, let's work on this.  It doesn't even seem pointless.  Of course, we don't have children.  So we've got that luxury of being able to have a very, you know, objective reality.  But I would say even with children, the reason they stay is very little to do with their  love for their partner and a lot more to do with their lack of love for themselves.  They don't know if they can meet somebody again.  They don't know if you're going to have options or alternatives.  They don't know how they would cope without this partner.  And sometimes it's more they want to control the cheating partner and make sure that that  partner doesn't move on so fast.  So it's more is the intentions aren't always clean.  Now, some women and some men have very clean intentions when they forgive cheating.  And it's more just to keep the family alive and to keep it all there.  But I do wonder if everybody knew that they were going to be fine if they left their cheating  partner, would they stay?  And I think most people would leave if they knew they would be totally fine.  So it's a lack of knowledge of knowing what the other side of life would look like.
