 Well, what's happening is men think that they're in control more than they actually are.  Men think they're the picks because, especially with the podcast scene,  they'll tell you, oh, women, she ages out at 30.  Or this woman, yeah, Myron, dumbass.  But they'll say, women age out at 30.  Women, your timeline is so short.  They don't realize that for women, especially in this day and age, the timeline is endless.  When a woman turns 20, she's got every guy from 18 to 30 following her and messaging her.  But when she turns 30, she's just got the same amount of men just pushed forward.  It's 30 to 40.  When she turns 40, there are still men 40 to 60 seeing her as a young chick.  If she's attractive, her queue is endless.  And what men think is, oh, but she's 35.  She's over.  Oh, but she's been with guys.  It doesn't work like that anymore because before it might have been like that  because everybody in your town has coupled up.  But now, especially if she's got an open Instagram profile, the offers are endless.  It's endless.
